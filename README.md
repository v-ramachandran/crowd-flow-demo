# CrowdFlow Proof of Concept

This repository contains a high-level task decomposed into a Workflow of Crowdsourced tasks. In order to crowdsource the decomposed tasks, Amazon Mechanical Turk will be used. The actual workflow itself will be completed through the Amazon SWF workflow framework.

Gradle is used to build the overall project.
